## Dependencies
I've included Bond (via Carthage) as a dependency to support the MVVM view binding.

I've also included [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble), which is a simple matcher framework for tests.

## Testing
I've included a sample response in the testing bundle so we can validate tests against a known response and not hit the network.
